This is an app I'm working on as a learning exercies. It started as a project from Alex the Analyst at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiOtQMcI5wg&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF&index=65

The goal for it is to allow you to add amazon urls to a text file which you can then use to create a csv file with the title, price, and url. It then tracks the price every 24 hours and sends you an email if their is a change/

I'm having a little trouble getting the title and price to stay correct due to changes in the Amazon web site
